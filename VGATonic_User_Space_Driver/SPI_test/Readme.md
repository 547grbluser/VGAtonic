This demo is meant for the Arduino Uno to show Hardware Acceleration on VGATonic.

Connect VGATonic's SCK to pin 13, VGATonic's MOSI to pin 11, and VGATonic's Chip Select to pin 9.  Then provide power.  The Arduino Uno will run at only 2 MHz SPI, but show how to skip to individual lines.

There is other code in here showing how to write and how to change resoutions and modes.
