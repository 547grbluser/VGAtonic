VGAtonic
========

Entry level embedded video card in a neat little CPLD package.

What it is:

VGAtonic aims to be an embedded video card - a controller and a framebuffer - for headless devices such as microcontrollers, single board computers, and the like.  It'll target one of the first generation display technologies (NTSC and/or VGA), and the reference design will fit into a reasonably easy-to-solder CPLD.

How it's made:

VHDL for the CPLD
C/C++ for any Microcontroller and Computer glue
Python to hold the whole thing together

How it's licensed:

MIT

What it's for:

A nice user interface for my wife on an embedded Linux box, open sourced for all you folks because of the Hackaday Prize.  See VGAtonic here: http://hackaday.io/project/1943-VGAtonic
